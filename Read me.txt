In this project, I simulate how the CPU scheduling process is based on three different technic.
 1-Shortest Remaining Time Scheduling (SETS)
2- priority Scheduling (non-preemptive)
3-Round Robin (RR)
1) Software and hardware tools you used
Software: 
1.JAVA porogramming language
1.Eclipse IDE
2.Text editor
Hardware:
1.Ryzen 5 5600x
2.Nvidia 3060Ti 

2) Strengths and weaknesses of the program
1-In the priority algorithm, we read the processes from the file and process them and compute their average 
waiting time and average completion time based on their priority with time complexity BigO(n2).
2-For the SRTF itâ€™s definitely the fastest of the 3 methods, but the problem is its complexity and 
the number of switches needed to finish processing.
3-For Round Robin the main strength is that every process gets the same amount of CPU share,
so no starvation happens. 
4-we show which jobs are selected at what times as well as their starting and stopping burst values. by printing the results in terms of a Gantt chart.
